# Observer

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact: Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.

- We say a object is tightly coupled to another object when it is too dependent on that object. A loosely coupled object doesnâ€™t know or care too much about the details of another object.
