- Encapsulation: Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private, inside a class. Other objects don’t have direct access to this state. Instead, they can only call a list of public functions — called methods.
- Abstraction: Abstraction can be thought of as a natural extension of encapsulation. Applying abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it.
- Inheritance: Class adds only what is necessary for it while reusing common logic with the parent classes.
- Polymorphism: Polymorphism gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there’s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are.
